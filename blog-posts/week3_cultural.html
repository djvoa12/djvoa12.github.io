        <pre>My personal thinking style is mostly concrete random, which means I am an experimenter.  My perceptual quality is concrete so I register information directly through my five senses.  My ordering ability is random, meaning I let my mind organize information by chunks, and in no particular order.  It also enables me to skip steps in a procedure and still produce the desired result.

My concrete random thinking style can be advantageous in DBC.  I enjoy experimenting and going through the trial-and-error processes.  I feel that this is one of best ways to learn to code.  There is no abstract meaning behind code and it does what you tell it to do.  Furthermore, my random ordering ability could prove to be beneficial if I can achieve the same result with less time.

I recently read an <a href="https://medium.com/the-business-of-living/why-quantity-should-be-your-priority-3bc2b16fe3f5">article</a> that is not directly related to web development, but it is indirectly related to many things in life, including web development.  It explains that quantity should be your priority and not quality because quantity leads to higher quality.  I can relate to this article as one keeps experimenting with code, he or she will learn what works and what doesn't and, over time, his or her findings and self-teachings will lead to well-written code.

My biggest challenges come from learning to do something new entirely.  For example, learning to use Git proved difficult as I never used it before.  However, after repeating the commands many times, I am now proficient in using the basic commands.  If you do something so many times, it will eventually click.

I think I can expand the ways I learn and think by incorporating more step-by-step analysis more often.  My mind tends to analyze information in chunks, but I know I can achieve same result faster if I organize my thoughts together.</pre>
