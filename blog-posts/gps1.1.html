          <h3>What is pair programming?</h3>
          <p>Pair programing occurs when two developers work together at one workstation.  The driver types the code while the navigator reviews each line of code that is being typed in.  They also share thoughts as they work through the process of coding and switch roles frequently.</p>

          <h3>Why is pair programming important to DBC?</h3>
          <p>At DBC, one is expected to pair almost all the time.  This is practiced because pair or group programming is very common in the actual workplace, and DBC wants its Boots to become very familiar with this.  It also helps us learn faster and make fewer mistakes.</p>

          <h3>GPS 1.1 Reflection</h3>
          <p>I think my very first guided pairing session went well.  I was a little nervous beforehand because I didn't know what to expect.  Although I didn't have a partner so I had to drive and navigate by myself, my instructor, Connor Harwood, was able to guide me and point me in the right direction when I needed help.  He also gave me useful tips regarding some of the new elements in HTML5 and explained their nesting capabalities compared to the previous version of HTML.  Lastly, I am glad that I learned enough in the first week and a half in Phase 0 to be able to finish the session without too much difficulty.</p>
