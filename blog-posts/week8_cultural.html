        <pre><b>1. Discuss a time you had an emotional conflict with someone. What was it about? What happened?</b>

My friend from college used to make jokes about me from time to time in front of me and others.  It was funny for him and others around him, but I didn't find it very funny because it happened frequently.

<b>2. What was the source of the conflict?</b>

See above.

<b>3. How did you handle that conflict?</b>

I didn't handle it very well in the end.  I just didn't say anything, kept it to myself, and bottled up all the negative emotions.  Sadly, emotional conflict transformed into physical conflict in the end.

<b>4. Did your actions make the conflict better or worse?</b>

It made it worse.

<b>5. If you could go back, what would you do differently, if anything?</b>

If I could go back, I think I would have not bottled up all the negative emotions.  Instead, I would try to exude discomfort and let him know how I felt at the time.

When I look back now, I am not sure why I let those types of things get to me.  I feel that I am such a much different person now than who I was five years ago.  In the recent years, I have been used to dividing emotional conflicts into two types: the one that will affect me personally and one that is not.  Given that this was an ongoing today, I would have totally brushed this off instantly and I wouldn't even be frustrated.

<b>6. What did you learn from this experience?</b>

I learned that I should not bottle up anger and frustration.  I should, instead, identify the issue and try to resolve it.</pre>
