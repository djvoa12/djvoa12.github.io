        <pre>Everyone has a certain social identity.  We all belong to certain groups and social categories, such as our age, sex, race, religion, nationality, etc.  Along with the social identity, comes stereotype threat that can hurt your academic or professional performance.  I am male, of Asian descent, and affected by the stereotype threat in the tech industry.

Asian-Americans make up a large portion of the technology workforce.  Thus, stereotypes that Asians are good at math and belong in the tech field are reiterated.  This negatively impacts me, because I've identified that some people may make assumptions about my skill set based on a generic identification with my race. I've encountered situations where others have identified that I can excel only at a specific set of tasks because of my racial identity. In these situations I've been expected to perform at a higher level at some tasks and never been given the opportunity to solve other problems that are not associated with those tasks because of my race.

If I were to feel a stereotype threat, I think the best course of action for me is to just disregard those threats because I am self-driven and I can't have stereotypes create a road block or slow me down.  I've learned that success in life is not determined by the initial assessment strangers may develop about me. But, about my resilience to continually develop and challenge myself to improve.</pre>
