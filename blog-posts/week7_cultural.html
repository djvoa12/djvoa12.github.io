Exercise 1:<br>
When you think of the times in your life where youâ€™ve been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, which of the following values come to mind?
<br></br>
Achievement, Adventure, Affection, Ambition, Creativity, Friendships, Helping society, Knowledge, Meaningful work, Money, Music, Personal development, Romance
<br></br>
Exercise 2:<br>
Pick one or two values and write a couple of sentences about why they are important to you.
<br></br>
Meaningful work - Most people spend good percentage of their time working at their jobs.  So why not enjoy what you do?  I would hate to spend a lot of my time just to do meaningless work.
<br></br>
Music - This is my favorite thing in life.  It is soothing and affects my emotional state.
<br></br>
Exercise 3:<br>
Answer the following for the values you chose in Exercise 1:<br>
In general, I try to live up to these values:<br>
Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- 4 ----- 5 Agree
<br></br>
Achievement - 5<br>
Adventure - 5<br>
Affection - 4<br>
Ambition - 5<br>
Creativity - 5<br>
Friendships - 5<br>
Helping society - 3<br>
Knowledge - 4<br>
Meaningful work - 5<br>
Money - 4<br>
Music - 5<br>
Personal development - 5<br>
Romance - 4
<br></br>
Exercise 4:<br>
What was the last topic that someone asked for your advice on? Does it relate to your values?
<br></br>
The last topic someone asked me for advice was related to achievement, ambition, and meaningful work.
<br></br>
Exercise 5:
Values can be a powerful way to negate stereotype threat if you can bring them to mind when you are under a threat. For this part, consider:
- How do you feel when you think about your values?<br>
- Do you think it can help you mediate stereotype threat if you recognize you feel it?<br>
- Can you think of any mental or physical exercises you can use to help you when you are feeling down (for whatever reason) at DBC?
<br></br>
I feel that those values describe what is important to me.  If I were to feel a stereotype threat, I know my values will subdue the threat because I know what is important to me and nothing else can throw me off my path to success.  Lastly, music has been my medicine of choice for the times when I am feeling down.
