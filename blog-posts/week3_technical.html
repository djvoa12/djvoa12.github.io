Why is JavaScript popular in web development?
<br></br>
JavaScript is very popular in web development due to its ability to deliver rich and dynamic web content.  It's a scripting language that fully supports web development and very responsive and interactive in creating HTML files.  Moreover, it was initally developed as a browser-agnostic scriptiing language and has evolved to mobile and server-side web applications as well.  It is poised to be the dominant language of the enterprise for IT, which may ultimately replace other languages, such as C, C++, and Java.
<br></br>
What are the great things about JavaScript?
<br></br>
- All the browsers support it<br>
- Supports functional programming language<br>
- Can be used as client as well as server side<br>
- Support objects and inheritance<br>
- Quick and responsive<br>
- Communicates well with the server<br>
- Universal front-end platform<br>
- Multiple devices (tablets, e-readers, smart phones, etc.)<br>
- Ability to meet demands of rapid development, while at the same time maximizing the user experience
<br></br>
What are its limitations?
<br></br>
- Cannot write to files on the server without the help of server side script (Using Ajax, JS can send a request to the server)<br>
- Cannot accesss databases<br>
- Cannot read from or write to files in the client<br>
- Cannot close a window if it didn't open it<br>
- Cannot access web pages hosted on another domain<br>
- Cannot protect your page source or images<br>
- Does not have multithreading capabilities<br>
- Depends a lot on the browser (different browsers interpret JS differently)
