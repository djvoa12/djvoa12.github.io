  <div id="reflection">
    The topic covered in Exercise 5 was about responsive design and the things that define it, such as fluid layout, fluid images, and media queries.  Fluid layout is proportionally laying out your website so elements take up the same percent of space on different screen sizes.  Fluid image lets an image shrink down within the confines and can only ever be as large as its pixel value so it does not get pixelated or stretched.  Media queries present different layouts based on screen sizes/types of screens.  The right balance of these three approaches combined can really can vastly improve user experience at all levels of screen sizes.
    <br></br>
    I also learned about the concept of mobile first approach for responsive design, where designing the mobile phone experience comes first and then works upwards to tablets, laptops, desktops, and more.  Moreover, beyond various screen resolutions, I was exposed to the challenge of multiple pixel densities, which are handled differently.
    <br></br>
    This exercise, along with the prep materials, threw a lot of design concepts at me today.  It was facinating getting to know the approaches that are being used today, and it just solidifies the fact that technology is constantly evolving and design needs to evolve with it.
