One of the biggest problems facing the tech industry today is gender gap, particularly in the executive ranks.  Google recently issued a <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2014/05/29/technology/google-white-males/index.html?iid=EL">report</a> on the company's diversity in the spring, and according to it, just 30% of Google employees are women.  On the contrary, about 48% of the company's non-tech jobs are held by women.  Furthermore, 17% of Google's engineers are females, and women make up 21% of the company's leadership.
<br></br>
The problem is not apparent only for Google.  Other notable tech companies, such as Twitter and Facebook, are experiencing the same issue.  As women make up about half the population in the country, how can we improve the sex ratio in the tech world?
<br></br>
I believe that these issues should be addressed in school.  High schools should raise awareness of the gender inequality in the workforce and encourage girls to take courses that may raise their interest level for the STEM career fields.  According to the College Board, only 17% of high school students who take Advanced Placement Computer Science tests are girls, and less than 13% of computer science graduates are women.
<br></br>
Increasing the supply of female graduates from universities and coding camps will help gradually improve the sex ratio in tech companies.  With more female talent flowing in, these companies are more likely to hire qualified women, and as more women flood the industry, Silicon Valley's notorious culture of sexism will be getting addressed as well.
