        <pre><b>Exercise 1:</b>
<span>When you think of the times in your life where youâ€™ve been the happiest, the proudest, or the most satisfied, which of the following values come to mind?</span>

Achievement, Adventure, Affection, Ambition, Creativity, Friendships, Helping society, Knowledge, Meaningful work, Money, Music, Personal development, Romance

<b>Exercise 2:</b>
<span>Pick one or two values and write a couple of sentences about why they are important to you.</span>

Meaningful work - Most people spend good percentage of their time working at their jobs.  So why not enjoy what you do?  I would hate to spend a lot of my time just to do meaningless work.

Music - This is my favorite thing in life.  It is soothing and affects my emotional state.

<b>Exercise 3:</b>
<span>Answer the following for the values you chose in Exercise 1:
In general, I try to live up to these values:
Disagree 1 ----- 2 ----- 3 ----- 4 ----- 5 Agree</span>

Achievement - 5
Adventure - 5
Affection - 4
Ambition - 5
Creativity - 5
Friendships - 5
Helping society - 3
Knowledge - 4
Meaningful work - 5
Money - 4
Music - 5
Personal development - 5
Romance - 4

<b>Exercise 4:</b>
<span>What was the last topic that someone asked for your advice on? Does it relate to your values?</span>

The last topic someone asked me for advice was related to achievement, ambition, and meaningful work.

<b>Exercise 5:</b>
<span>Values can be a powerful way to negate stereotype threat if you can bring them to mind when you are under a threat. For this part, consider:
- How do you feel when you think about your values?
- Do you think it can help you mediate stereotype threat if you recognize you feel it?
- Can you think of any mental or physical exercises you can use to help you when you are feeling down (for whatever reason) at DBC?</span>

I feel that those values describe what is important to me.  If I were to feel a stereotype threat, I know my values will subdue the threat because I know what is important to me and nothing else can throw me off my path to success.  Lastly, music has been my medicine of choice for the times when I am feeling down.</pre>
