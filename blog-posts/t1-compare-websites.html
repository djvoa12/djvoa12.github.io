I think this site really differentiates itself from other search engines with its minimalistic design, while the other search engines are cluttered with ads, latest news, weather, etc.  When you enter the site, the logo and a search bar draw your attention.  It's straight forward and help you search for whatever you want, distraction-free.
<br></br>
The site is well-branded, minimalistic, inviting, and simple.  There isn't much content on the main page, which makes it a very practical site.  So go search away!

This news site feels very inviting, at least for me, when I enter its home page.  I like the partial red and parchment-like background colors, which are easy on the eyes.  The biggest news, usually accompanied by a large image, takes spotlight on the main page along with couple ads every now and then.  Then, if you scroll down, you can see that it follows a grid format and it lists all other news with headliners on the left-hand side.  Some are more featured and located in the middle; they include a picture and a small description.  Once you scroll down even further, you will find that it has organized the news into different types of categories.
<br></br>
The site is organized, friendly, neat, and navigable.  There aren't too many ads so you can go see what's going on in the news today without too many distractions.

soundcloud.com

I would describe this site as the YouTube of audio-tracks.  It helps artists showcase and spread their work through social networking.  The main page is made up of couple images and an audio track, which you could listen to by clicking on the play button.  You can then search for a particular artist by typing in the search bar, check out music that is trending by clicking on "Explore", or sign-up to make your own account which you could use to promote your work, if you have any, or just make a playlist of songs you liked.
<br></br>
The site is organized, simple, minimalistic, and friendly.  It has been ad-free so far so go take advantage of it while it lasts.
