        <pre><b><u>Pairing:</u></b>

<b>What was it like to pair with others to solve challenges?</b>

Pairing sessions are great because they introduce me to other students who are driven, curious, and motivated.  While it's fun to meet new people, pairing is different than working by myself because I have to be considerate, communicate my thoughts, and work as a team.  The sessions that I had, so far, went well for the most part.  I am an experimenter by nature so I work really well with someone who likes to engage in trial-and-error process to solve challenges.

<b>Was something particularly fun or rewarding?</b>

I really enjoyed talking to my fellow boots about our current phase 0 experience and what is to come.  I think we are all nervous as many of us are quitting our jobs for this program, and knowing that there are others who are taking a leap makes me feel better and lets me know I am not alone.  As for the challenges, it is most rewarding when we get through them with both of our ideas put together and both of us are carrying about equal weight.

<b>Was something frustrating and difficult for you?</b>

The GPSs have not always been smooth.  I try to get through the challenges quickly because the instructor is with us for only an hour and he or she could provide valuable input during the more challenging releases, which naturally come later.  When I am paired with another experimenter, things can go smooth, and we plow through the challenges.  However, when I encounter a pair who is thinking silently and is not typing anything (i.e. experimenting) as the driver, I get frustrated.  I think the instructor should enter the session after about half hour.  That way, my partner and I can read through the objectives and go through the initial releases before the instructor enters.  I just feel that the time allotted for guidance is better suited for later releases.

<b><u>Feedback:</u></b>

<b>How did you feel when you read your feedback?</b>

After reading feedback, I feel that I am on the right track technically and culturally.  Many students left me constructive feedback that are actionable.  They were kind and uplifting as well.

<b>Was the feedback you received helpful to your learning?</b>

Yes, they let me know what the other students were thinking and feeling when they were pairing with me.  They are very important because I care about how I am being perceived by my peers and they will, in turn, help me mold myself into a better partner in the future.

<b>Based on the feedback you've received, what are you going to do to improve next time you pair?</b>

I am going to listen to the actionable suggestions.  I will think out loud more, try not to get too ahead of myself, and improve my communication skills.

<b>How was it to write feedback?</b>

I think feedback is great because I can anonymously let my partners know my thoughts and emotions that arose during our sessions.

<b>What was most difficult for you when writing feedback for your pair?</b>

I found that it's tough for me leave an actionable feedback when the pairing sessions go smooth.  I definitely don't want to nitpick and bring up things that are not necessary and actionable.</pre>
