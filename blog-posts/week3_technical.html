        <pre><b>Why is JavaScript popular in web development?</b>

JavaScript is very popular in web development due to its ability to deliver rich and dynamic web content.  It's a scripting language that fully supports web development and very responsive and interactive in creating HTML files.  Moreover, it was initially developed as a browser-agnostic scripting language and has evolved to mobile and server-side web applications as well.  It is poised to be the dominant language of the enterprise for IT, which may ultimately replace other languages, such as C, C++, and Java.

<b>What are the great things about JavaScript?</b>

- All the browsers support it
- Supports functional programming language
- Can be used as client as well as server side
- Support objects and inheritance
- Quick and responsive
- Communicates well with the server
- Universal front-end platform
- Multiple devices (tablets, e-readers, smart phones, etc.)
- Ability to meet demands of rapid development, while at the same time maximizing the user experience

<b>What are its limitations?</b>

- Cannot write to files on the server without the help of server side script (Using Ajax, JS can send a request to the server)
- Cannot access databases
- Cannot read from or write to files in the client
- Cannot close a window if it didn't open it
- Cannot access web pages hosted on another domain
- Cannot protect your page source or images
- Does not have multithreading capabilities
- Depends a lot on the browser (different browsers interpret JS differently)</pre>
