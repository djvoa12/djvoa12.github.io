        <pre>Based on the video, I think DBC experience is what you make of it.  I was slightly consumer-minded when I first sign up this experience.  I wanted to pay my tuition and was looking for DBC to give me the experience that I wanted.  What I found out was that this whole camp is an experiment, and it's only going to be as good as how much each and every one of us contribute to the environment and the goal of becoming a world-class beginner in software engineering.

I have never been in an environment like this where people makes the experience.  My education up to this point has been consumer-oriented, where I was expecting a certain experience based on the class, teacher, or feedback from former students.  Although this is all new to me, I feel that I can definitely be a contributor to this new environment, where all boots can thrive and learn to reach their goals.

My expectations have changed slightly as I am now truly accepting that I am part of this new experience.  I am excited to contribute, but I am a little nervous as I have never encountered this type of learning atmosphere.  I obviously don't want to be the weakest link, asked to repeat a phase, or asked to leave.  I want to make sure I get out of this 18-week camp as a world-class beginner.

I know I enrolled in DBC because I am very interested in technology and wanted to be challenged.  I have no doubt that I will be challenged, and I feel that this experience will really test my character and determination.</pre>
